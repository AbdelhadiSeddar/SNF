EACH Folder under Server/ and Client/ Have their own license See the LICENSE on the part of this repository that you plan to use.

I have initially wanted to license Server/C and Client/Java and the README.md under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, so i put the LICENSE in the root directory, but since i have plans for other things, i have put the Necessary License on each folder ( and in README.md ) to clear up the confusion of what license each part uses.
