/// Thread Pools By Abdelhadi Seddar
/// This implemantation of a Threadpool is by no means perfect
/// nor optimized, because I made it based of a graph depicting
/// how a threadpool works, without seeing any documentation about it,
/// this is just a learning experience for
/// me and im learning through trial and error.
///
/// **UPDATE 0.0.2-alpha**:
/// After research and trial and error, and feedback from
/// other people and after trying it in a project, i realized 
/// that i made the implementation wrong, as i used to create
/// each threads whenever there is a `work` to do, which added
/// CPU Time and latency, so after Reading this [Wikipedia Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool)
/// (Last visited on Augest 2, 2024 at 2:37 PM GMT +1)
/// I noticed that i should've created the threads **At once** 
/// and **from the beggining**. so i did just that in this update
/// and it did do wonders after comparing the performance 
/// of the two (and doesnt crash as often as 0.0.1-alpha)
