# Welcome to SNF's C library!

## Warning
The library right now is a **static** Library so be aware of lisencing, i am planning to make the project compile a Shared Library.
## Disclaimer
This directory is the code source for the C library of SNF , this library is for creating the server side only and not the client side check the **Clients** directory for all Client libraries that are available.
Although it currently only Contains currently an incomplete java library, but i'm currectly working on improuving it and making other languages once i can.

## About this library
This library is used for C programs who want to host the server side of the snf, the goal is making simple to use library that simplifies server/client handling, and also to be highly customizable! although there would limitaions of cause due to this project still being in alpha phase still.
